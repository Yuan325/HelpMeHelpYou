# HelpMeHelpYou

#### TechTogether New York 2020 - Virtual
##### Winner for Best Use of Google Cloud

When social contacts have to be limited, we are taking a modern approach to implement it.
Inspiration of HelpMeHelpYou derives from the idea of a 'bulletin board' where people can post their notices and others could see them! 

HelpMeHelpYou is built with React for frontend, and Cloud Firebase for backend (authentication and Firestore database). We decided on Firebase due to it's flexibility and simplicity in implementation (auth, databases, messaging, real-time feature, geo feature, and even cloud functions if needed in the future!)
